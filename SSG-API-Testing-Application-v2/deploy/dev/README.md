# `dev`

This folder contains the files that are used for the creation of a `dev` environment.

Folder structure within `dev` should mirror that of `prod`, and vice versa.

Make sure to test your infrastructural and code changes on `dev` first before you migrate the changes over to
`prod` to avoid breaking the application in `prod`.
